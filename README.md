[FIRST COURSE WORK]

We with my friend after learning programming for 3 month wanted to create some game </br>
UE4 is too hard to learn in short terms, that is why we decide to use some kind of graphic lib </br>
And finally we found. SFML free lib that is cross-platform and based on low-level OpenGL </br>
to tell the truth this lib is very bad, how we understood later (I'm talking about speed of </br>
developing and work-speed (basic empty window without any kind of properties takes 40% of GPU, my GC: 1050 GTX)).It gave us permission to </br>
native event loop and we have to work with it</br>
 </br>
 
 </br>Concept was of creating clone of legendary game Civilization 1 </br>
 </br>I don't think that any of u'll check this repo, that is why </br>
 I won't write about inteface because I have to write a lot about it </br>
 I just wil say that we did to much, my friend had a lot of problems </br>
 that is why I wrote 70% of project by myself </br>
 
  </br>In short preview we can: </br>
  -Start new game </br>
  -Continue prev </br>
  -Load any game </br>
  -Exit

 </br>In game we cat: </br>
-Open on tab watching of hotkeys </br> </br>
-Build town </br>
-Destroy town </br>
-Take over the town </br>
-Build several units with several features
